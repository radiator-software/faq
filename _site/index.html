<h2 id="general-questions"><a href="#general">General questions</a></h2>

<h3 id="what-is-the-best-radius-server"><a href="#best-radius-server">What is the best RADIUS server?</a></h3>

<p>From our point of view, Radiator AAA Server is the best choice for <strong>RADIUS</strong>, <strong>Diameter</strong> and other <strong>AAA</strong> server needs. Because of the flexibility of Radiator, our customers call it the <em>Swiss Army knife of RADIUS servers</em>. More info on Radiator can be found from Radiator product site <a href="">https://radiatorsoftware.com/products/radiator/</a></p>

<h3 id="is-radiator-open-source"><a href="#is-radiator-open-source">Is Radiator open source?</a></h3>

<p>Radiator is not open source, but when you purchase Radiator, full source code is always supplied.</p>

<h3 id="how-much-does-radiator-cost"><a href="#how-much-radiator-cost">How much does Radiator cost?</a></h3>

<p>You can see selected Radiator licence prices at <a href="">https://radiatorsoftware.com/pricelist/</a>. Pricing for the Radiator add-on modules is provided upon request by contacting Radiator sales.</p>

<h3 id="who-is-using-radiator"><a href="#who-is-using-radiator">Who is using Radiator?</a></h3>

<p>Radiator AAA server is used for user and network authentication by a huge range of different organisations: educational institutions, cities, governmental organisations, ISPs and telecom companies, managed service providers, utility companies, and private businesses in various fields such as hospitality, finance, defence and medical industries.</p>

<h3 id="references"><a href="#references">References</a></h3>

<p>Radiator has a large and active worldwide customer base. Please see our website for customer references: <a href="">https://radiatorsoftware.com/customers/</a></p>

<h3 id="is-there-an-online-demo-available"><a href="#online-demo">Is there an online demo available?</a></h3>

<p>There is a Radiator Demo Cloud online demo - you can book a timeslot to go through typical Radiator use cases (or possibly your own use case) with Radiator experts.</p>

<h3 id="where-is-the-radiator-team-based"><a href="#radiator-team-based">Where is the Radiator team based?</a></h3>

<p>The Radiator team is based in Finland, where development and sales are done. At the same time, we also have a worldwide partner network providing support and consultation.</p>

<h3 id="who-is-behind-radiator"><a href="#who-is-behind-radiator">Who is behind Radiator?</a></h3>

<p>Radiator was developed by Australian-based <em>Open System Consultants (OSC)</em> 1998-2013, until the Finnish team acquired OSC in 2013 and took over Radiator development and business. The resulting company is Radiator Software.</p>

<h3 id="who-is-the-manufacturer-for-radiator"><a href="#manufacturer-for-radiator">Who is the manufacturer for Radiator?</a></h3>

<p><em>Radiator Software Oy</em> is the sole manufacturer of Radiator AAA Server software. <em>Radiator Software</em> sells Radiator licences globally and you can buy a licence directly from the Radiator team. Radiator licences are also sold through various distribution partners all over the world.</p>

<h2 id="licencing"><a href="#licencing">Licencing</a></h2>

<h3 id="how-radiator-licencing-works"><a href="#how-radiator-licencing-works">How Radiator licencing works?</a></h3>

<p>Radiator licencing is based on the number of servers used by the customer organisation. Radiator is available in different licence sizes starting from single server <strong>Radiator Single Pack</strong> and up to unlimited server count <strong>Radiator Enterprise Pack</strong>.</p>

<p>Radiator can be extended with <strong>Radiator Carrier Pack</strong>, <strong>Radiator SIM Pack</strong>, <strong>Radiator Telco Pack</strong> and <strong>Radiator GBA/BSF Pack</strong>. Licencing for these add-on <em>Diameter modules</em> is based on the number of subscribers or alternatively concurrent sessions depending on the use case.</p>

<p>Other flexible licencing options are also available. Please contact Radiator sales if you’re interested in <strong>service provider</strong> licencing, <strong>VNF</strong> licencing, <strong>white-label OEM</strong> licencing or other models.</p>

<h3 id="is-there-a-demo-version-of-radiator"><a href="#demo-version-of-radiator">Is there a demo version of Radiator?</a></h3>

<p>Radiator is available as an <em>evaluation version</em>. You can request a free <em>30 day evaluation licence</em> by filling out our evaluation form: <a href="">https://radiatorsoftware.com/evaluation/</a>.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-the-difference-between-the-fully-licensed-and-demo-versions"><a href="#difference-between-fully-licensed-and-demo-versions">What is the difference between the fully licensed and demo versions?</a></h3>

<p>Evaluation software has the <em>full functionality of Radiator</em>. The difference is that evaluation software is time limited and requires a licence key to activate, and the source code is obscured.</p>
